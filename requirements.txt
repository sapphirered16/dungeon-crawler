# Requirements for the Terminal Dungeon Crawler game

# For the core game (no additional packages required for basic functionality)
# Python standard library is sufficient for the initial implementation

# Potential future enhancements that might require packages:
# colorama - for colored terminal output
# numpy - for advanced dungeon generation algorithms
# pyyaml - for configuration files
